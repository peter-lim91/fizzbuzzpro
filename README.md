# FizzBuzz Pro (Work in Progress)

## What is FizzBuzz Pro?
FizzBuzz + AI OCR + XaaS = Image based FizzBuzz as a service.  You upload an image and FizzBuzz Pro will FizzBuzz any numbers it finds in the image.

## Why? 

To preempt any can FizzBuzz technical "tests"- but also because it provided an opportunity to use and learn the following

- `Next.js`
- `React`
- `Express.js`
- Session Management with cookies 
- sqlite3/postgres for storing session data - `knex`
- Sending emails via an api (Sendgrid)
- Handling file uploads
- Manipulating Images with Graphics Magick
- Google Vision API
- 

First, run the development server: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
