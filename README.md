# FizzBuzz Pro (Work in Progress)

## What is FizzBuzz Pro?
FizzBuzz + AI OCR + XaaS = Image based FizzBuzz as a service.  You upload an image and FizzBuzz Pro will FizzBuzz any numbers it finds in the image.

## But why?

I'd already created the core "feature". Turning it into an actual service provided the opportunity to use and learn the following.

- Next.js
- React
- Express.js
- Session Management with cookies 
- Storing session data in a database
- Sending emails via an api 
- Handling file uploads to an api endpoint
- Manipulating Images with Graphics Magick
- Google Vision API
